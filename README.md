# Global COVID-19 vaccination tracker dashboard using Tableau

In this data analyses project, I have evaluated the amount of population that have been vaccinated. The following dashboard shows some key metrics such as,
- Fully, partially and non vaccinated people across the countries.
- The influence of GDP (Gross Domestic Product) of the country over the vaccination of the population

This dashboard can be used to classify the different population groups to develop strategies to improves the vaccination drive.
